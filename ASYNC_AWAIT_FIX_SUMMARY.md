# Async/Await Fix Summary

## Problem Identified
The error `TypeError: object int can't be used in 'await' expression` was occurring because:

1. **Non-async callback methods**: Several callback methods in the conversation handler were not declared as `async` but were calling async Telegram API methods.

2. **Missing await keywords**: Some callback methods were being called without the `await` keyword.

## Files Modified
- `telegram_bot.py`: Fixed async/await issues in conversation handlers

## Specific Changes Made

### 1. Fixed `start_conversation` method calls
**Before:**
```python
return self.handle_threshold_callback(query, data, context)
return self.handle_tp_multipliers_callback(query, context)  
return self.handle_settings_callback(query, data)
```

**After:**
```python
return await self.handle_threshold_callback(query, data, context)
return await self.handle_tp_multipliers_callback(query, context)
return await self.handle_settings_callback(query, data)
```

### 2. Made callback methods async
**Before:**
```python
def handle_threshold_callback(self, query, data, context):
def handle_tp_multipliers_callback(self, query, context):
def handle_settings_callback(self, query, data):
```

**After:**
```python
async def handle_threshold_callback(self, query, data, context):
async def handle_tp_multipliers_callback(self, query, context):
async def handle_settings_callback(self, query, data):
```

### 3. Added await to Telegram API calls
**Before:**
```python
query.edit_message_text(...)
```

**After:**
```python
await query.edit_message_text(...)
```

### 4. Fixed all `show_threshold_settings` calls
**Before:**
```python
self.show_threshold_settings(query)
```

**After:**
```python
await self.show_threshold_settings(query)
```

## Testing Results
- ✅ Bot initialization test passed
- ✅ Conversation handler tests passed
- ✅ All async/await issues resolved
- ✅ No more `TypeError: object int can't be used in 'await' expression` errors

## Root Cause
The issue was in the conversation handler system where:
1. The `ConversationHandler` expects async callback functions
2. Some callback methods were synchronous but called async Telegram API methods
3. The conversation system was trying to await integer return values (conversation states) instead of coroutines

## Impact
- Fixed the main error causing bot crashes
- Improved bot stability and reliability
- All conversation flows now work correctly
- No impact on existing functionality

## Verification
The fix has been verified through:
1. Bot initialization tests
2. Conversation handler unit tests
3. Manual testing of conversation flows
4. No async/await warnings or errors in logs

The bot is now ready for deployment with proper async/await handling throughout the conversation system.
