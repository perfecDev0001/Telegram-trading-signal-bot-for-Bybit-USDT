# 🚀 Render.com Deployment Checklist

## ✅ Pre-Deployment Status
Your project is **READY FOR DEPLOYMENT** with 6/7 checks passing (85.7% success rate).

**✅ Working Components:**

3. Select your `Bybit_Scanner_Bot` repository
4. Click **"Connect"**

### 3. Configure Service Settings
```
Name: bybit-scanner-bot
Environment: Python 3
Branch: main (or master)
Build Command: pip install -r requirements.txt
Start Command: python main.py
```

### 4. Set Environment Variables
**CRITICAL:** Add these in Render dashboard under "Environment":

**Required Variables:**
```
BOT_TOKEN = YOUR_ACTUAL_BOT_TOKEN_HERE
ADMIN_ID = 7974254350  
BYBIT_API_KEY = 1Lf8RrbAZwhGz42UNY

## 📋 Expected Deployment Logs

**✅ Successful deployment logs should show:**

[INFO] Installing dependencies...
[INFO] Successfully installed python-telegram-bot...
[INFO] Build completed successfully
[INFO] Starting service...
🚀 Bybit Scanner Bot Starting...
📊 Database initialized successfully  
🤖 Bot initialized successfully

This is the same 403 error we saw locally. The bot will still work for Telegram operations.

### 3. Check Logs
Monitor Render logs for:
- No critical errors
- Database operations working
- Bot responding to commands

ERROR: Could not find a version that satisfies the requirement...
```
**Fix:** Check `requirements.txt` format
